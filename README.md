This prototype web app uses computer vision to detect viral and bacterial pneumonia on chest x-rays. It’s a triage tool to help doctors identify high risk children fast. The app can accept batches of x-rays in jpg or png format. For each x-ray it outputs three possible conditions:
- No pneumonia
- Viral pneumonia
- Bacterial pneumonia


The model was trained on chest x-rays of children aged 1 to 5. 

Model F1 score: 0.76

The process used to build and train the model is described in this Kaggle kernel:<br>

All javascript, html and css files used to create the web app are available in this repo.
